Attributes rather than defintion

"You can't have a measure of complexity" explains Sarah Sheard in [Reducing Complexity in Software & Systems](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/library/asset-view.cfm?assetid=443886) because a measure is inherently a simplification. We can measure causes and attributes of it â€“ but complexity itself only increases.  Now go read Borges's [On Exactitude in Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Exactitude_in_Science) and stroke your chin.

I once stayed with someone at Hampshire College one time who burned all of his trash, calling it 'simplification.'

        ##### Affordance from Donald Norman
        A knob affords twisting.  Let the form follow the function.  The solution should be self-documenting.

        **7 stages of action**

        1. Forming the goal
        2. Forming the intention
        3. Specifying an action
        4. Executing the action
        5. Perceiving the state of the world
        6. Interpreting the state of the world
        7. Evaluating the outcome
