There are so many lists out there for software development, programming, etc that just go on and on.  Here's my attempt at a short list that touches on the tech but focuses on what software can do for people.

1. [Fred Brooks' _No Silver Bullet_](http://worrydream.com/refs/Brooks-NoSilverBullet.pdf).  A succinct statement of 'the problem of software': complexity, conformity, invisibility.  If you want more, follow it with [Ben Moseley and Peter Marks's _Out of the Tarpit_](http://curtclifton.net/papers/MoseleyMarks06a.pdf) .  And [Brooks's _Mythical Man Month_](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959).

2. [Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim's _Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps_](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339).  Three authors, two subtitles, and 24 specific recommendations based on a bunch of research. 288 pages but a good chunk of that is a review of their methodology.  Not much filler in here. Maybe follow it with [Camille Fournier's _The Manager's Path_](https://www.amazon.com/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-Growth/dp/1491973897) if you are figuring out how to handle not just tech but a team.

3. [Alan Cooper's _The Inmates are Running the Asylum_](https://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140). Not everything we do with software should point to a specific goal – but a lot should, and Cooper helped bring interaction design as a profession. You could follow with [Don Norman's _The Design of Everyday Things_](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded/dp/0465050654/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=the+design+of+everyday+things&qid=1643430479&s=books&sprefix=the+desing+o%2Cstripbooks%2C88&sr=1-1) or [Giff Constable's _Talking to Humans_](https://s3.amazonaws.com/TalkingtoHumans/Talking+to+Humans.pdf).

4. [David Maister's _Managing the Professional Service Firm_](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Professional-Service-David-Maister/dp/0684834316). Ostensibly written for law firms, this book's questions and insights can help you create more value for clients and work better with your team.  You could also try [Ian Cooper's _FT Guide to Business Development_](https://www.amazon.com/Financial-Times-Guide-Business-Development/dp/0273759531), [Julie Konrath's _Snap Selling_](https://www.amazon.com/SNAP-Selling-Business-Frazzled-Customers/dp/1591844703/), or [Jeff Thull's _Mastering the Complex Sale_](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Complex-Sale-Compete-Stakes/dp/0470533110) to tweak your sales brain.

5. [Eric Ries's _The Lean Start Up_](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898). Okay, yes, this one is definitely veering into airport layover material.  A lot of business is just about thinking, doing, and checking – and that's basically what this book outlines.  So yeah, it's a great primer on product development. You could follow it with [Ryan Singer's _Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup).

So let's call that five?
